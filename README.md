3. Cyclomatic complexity 
  
  G - graph <br />
  V(G) - cyclomatic complexity <br />
  E - edges <br />
  N - nodes <br />
  
  V(G) = E â€“ N + 2 = 26 - 20 + 2 = 8
  


4. Every Statement Method

The first test case is similar to the one provided from task 1, with the slight change in the input we reach to the node I as well. Two more test cases were needed to successfully fulfill the Every Statement Method. Test cases 2 and 3 are consistent of inadequate entries. Test case 2 is used to get to node B, test case 3 is used to get to node D.


5. Every Branch Method

 The same test cases from the Every Statement method apply to the Every Branch method as well.
