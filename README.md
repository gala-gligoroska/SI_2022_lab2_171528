3. Cyclomatic complexity 
  
  G - graph <br />
  V(G) - cyclomatic complexity <br />
  E - edges <br />
  N - nodes <br />
  
  V(G) = E â€“ N + 2 = 29 - 20 + 2 = 11

The first test case is the one provided from task 1. Two more test cases were needed to successfully fulfill the Every Statement Method. Test cases 2 and 3 are consistent of inadequate entries. Test case 2 is used to get to node B, test case 3 is used to get to node D.
